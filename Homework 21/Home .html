            <p> Most users we interviewed are experiencing loneliness and even though they are connected with their friends via social media isn't enganing enough </p>

              <p> After our interviews, our team developed Sara, our main persona. Sarah, an overwhelmed mother<br> of two, needs a meaningful way to connect with her family and friends because Covid 19 has limited her ability to physically connect to her community thus causing her to feel bored,  depressed, and disconnected.

                     <p> During our user interviews, we discovered that our users feel isolated and are in need of meaningful connections due to the Pandemic. <br> <div> </div>Therefore, we believe that by providing a virtual environment platform we will be able to provide an all inclusive social experience for users to connect with family and friends. <br> <div> </div> <br> We can accomplish this by allowing users to coordinate virtual classes chosen by the users interest. <br> </p>This platform will include features such as private and public video classrooms. The user can engage with others through our live group messaging. Doing this will allow users to engage with family and friends through a tailored virtual experience.

                            <p> In conclusion, as a team we have learned the importance of applying user insights to our iterations versus what we as designers feel is best.<br>
                               We have also learned that the problem statement should not outline our solution but indicate how it might play out.</p>
